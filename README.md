# Deep Learning building blocks for Tabular-like

This is an intermediate implementation on deep learning that focuses on how to design neural networks for various data types. This implementation uses different types of data(synthetic and real world type of data).  
The notebooks used here are totally derived from the work of [Nate](https://github.com/knathanieltucker/deep-learning-building-blocks/) on which I commented the code for the seek of cleanliness and to make it more understandable for beginners. Thanks to him for his great sharings. 

## Installing What You'll Need

Create an enviornment with the following command:

`virtualenv -p python3 env`

Install all the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Other Downloads

Downloading the [Kaggle Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset) will be necessary for the final notebook.

## TO-DO

Extend the pipeline given by the author and do my first submission on Kaggle.
